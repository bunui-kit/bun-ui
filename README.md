## 📚 Documentation

For detailed documentation and examples, visit the [Bun UI Documentation](https://bun-ui.com/docs).

## 💡 Open Code, Open Source

Bun UI is fully open source and designed with simplicity and developer freedom at its core. Many components are built using [@radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives, providing accessible and high-quality behavior while leaving styling and customization in your hands.

Need a custom version of a component? Simply copy the source from the library into your project directory and tweak it to fit your design or specific use case — no complicated overrides or internal coupling.
