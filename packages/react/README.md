## ðŸ“š Documentation

For detailed documentation and examples, visit the [Bun UI Documentation](https://bun-ui.com/docs).

## ðŸ’¡ Open Code, Open Source

Bun UI is fully open source and designed with simplicity and developer freedom at its core. Many components are built using [@radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) primitives, providing accessible and high-quality behavior while leaving styling and customization in your hands.

Need a custom version of a component? Simply copy the source from the library into your project directory and tweak it to fit your design or specific use case â€” no complicated overrides or internal coupling.

I believe great UI libraries should be transparent, flexible, and easy to extend.
