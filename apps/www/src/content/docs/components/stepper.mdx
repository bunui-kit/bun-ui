<ComponentPreview name="stepper-basic" />

## Usage

Import the `Stepper` component and its subcomponents from `@bun-ui/react`:

```jsx
import { Stepper, Step, StepLabel } from "@bun-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<Stepper activeStep={1}>
  <Step>
    <StepLabel>Step 1</StepLabel>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepLabel>Step 2</StepLabel>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepLabel>Step 3</StepLabel>
  </Step>
</Stepper>
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

A simple stepper with three steps, showing the second step as active.

<ComponentPreview name="stepper-basic" />

### Custom Connector

You can customize the connector between steps using the `connector` prop.

<ComponentPreview name="stepper-custom-connector" />

### Completed Steps

Steps can be marked as completed, showing a checkmark icon.

<ComponentPreview name="stepper-completed" />

### Custom Styling

The Stepper components can be customized using the `className` prop.

<ComponentPreview name="stepper-custom-styling" />

### Accessibility

The Stepper component is built with accessibility in mind. Each step should have a clear label and the active step should be visually distinct. The component uses appropriate ARIA attributes to indicate the current step and progress.

```jsx
<Stepper activeStep={1} aria-label="Registration steps">
  <Step>
    <StepLabel>Account Details</StepLabel>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepLabel>Personal Information</StepLabel>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepLabel>Confirmation</StepLabel>
  </Step>
</Stepper>
```
