## Usage

Import the `Link` component from `@bun-ui/react` and use it in your project:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@bun-ui/react"
```

```tsx
<Link href="#">Visit Example</Link>
```

## Examples

### Custom Rendering

The `Link` component supports rendering as a custom child element using the
`asChild` prop. This is useful for integrating with other components like
buttons.

<ComponentPreview name="link-customized" />

### Underline

<ComponentPreview name="link-underline" />

### Accessibility

The `Link` component is built with accessibility in mind. Ensure that links have
descriptive labels and are keyboard-navigable. Use the `aria-*` attributes where
necessary to provide additional context.

```tsx
<Link href="/" aria-label="Go to homepage">
  Home
</Link>
```

### Customization

The `Link` component can be customized using the `className` prop or by
extending its styles with your design system.

```tsx
<Link href="#" className="text-blue-500 underline hover:text-blue-700">
  Custom Styled Link
</Link>
```
