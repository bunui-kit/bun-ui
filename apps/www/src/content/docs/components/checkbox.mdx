<ComponentPreview name="checkbox-basic" />

## Usage

Import the `Checkbox` component from `@bun-ui/react` and use it in your project:

```tsx
import { Checkbox } from "@bun-ui/react"
```

```tsx
<Checkbox label="Accept terms and conditions" />
```

## Controlled

<ComponentPreview name="checkbox-controlled" />

## Custom Label

For advanced label customization, omit the label prop and use a separate label component:

<ComponentPreview name="checkbox-customized-label" />

## Notes

- Built on top of [@radix-ui/react-checkbox](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/checkbox) for enhanced accessibility and reliability.
- The label prop links an accessible label to the checkbox.
- If an id is not explicitly provided, a unique ID is automatically generated to associate the checkbox and its label.

Refer to the source code for more advanced usage and customization options.
