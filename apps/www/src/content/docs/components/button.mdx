<ComponentPreview name="button-sizes" />

### Disabled

### Accessibility

The `Button` component is built with accessibility in mind. Ensure that buttons have accessible labels and are keyboard-navigable. Use the `aria-*` attributes where necessary to provide additional context.

```jsx
<Button aria-label="Submit form">Submit</Button>
```

### Customization

The `Button` component can be customized using the `className` prop or by extending its styles with your design system.

```jsx
<Button className="bg-purple-500 text-white hover:bg-purple-600">
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

## Notes

- The `Button` component uses `class-variance-authority` for managing variants and sizes.
- The `asChild` prop allows you to render the button as a custom component, such as a `Link` or `div`.

Refer to the source code for more advanced usage and customization options.
